# A Library Management System

A Library Management system I built with Java offers a variety of features to help librarians and library staff efficiently manage and organize the library's collection, such as cataloging, circulation, user account management, and advanced search functions. The system also provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for tracking and monitoring resource usage, check-in and check-out.
